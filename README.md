<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This is a basic project that started with the facebook boilerplate Create-React-App using typescript and styled-components

For state management we use React Redux.

The project was developed in just 2 days, I tried to do it keeping a standard but something or another went out of scope, now the next steps are to correct these low-effort implementations that were left behind. :)

I apologize if there is anything out of the ordinary, I will still be working on the project, there are some things that I want to improve but from the beginning it is a project that was developed with great care. <3
